## Chapter 1

So, I completed my bachalor's degree and master's degree by the year 2018. Collage days were fun, I miss them sometimes. After that, I got job in the field of AI (Artificial Intelligence). This field is/was totally new to me but it's interesting. This AI ```(deep Learning)``` are nothing more then some Statistical model which can help the machine work like human brain ```(its tries to, not perfect yet. Long way to go still)```. I find this field interesting because with these models, we can really solve some dam complicated problems ```(using CNN, NLP, etc)``` for example **Tesla** uses lots of sensor data and other stuff for there self-driving car, oops! anyways. So, now am thinking to try a new field called ```Cyber Security``` or ```pentester```. I started with [HackTheBox](https://app.hackthebox.eu/)
